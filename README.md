# SQL-US-Presidents-Database
 An SQL database of US presidents and vice presidents.

I created a database of US Presidencies. My main tables are: US Presidents, Vice Presidents, Presidencies, Vice Presidencies, and Universities. I created three linking tables to handle many-to-many relationships. I thought this topic would be relatively straightforward, but the complexities of the US presidential system had to be accounted for in my databases.
Initially I attempted to build a database of video game sales, but it was far too complex for me at this point. The topic of US presidents ended up being a better way for me to work through common mistakes, errors, and bugs. Also, the topic is probably familiar to everyone, so it should be easier to present my results.

This project provides:
- Provide researchers quick access data about US presidents and vice presidents.
- Create insightful views that demonstrate a presence or absence of trends/correlations or reveal some interesting quirks in the institution of the US presidency.
- Information would only need to be updated when the current president or vice president changes.
- A complete version of this project would have an online interactive database where users can look up specific information or build their own custom views.
The database would be useful for journalists, historians, political scientists, and anyone interested in US history.
